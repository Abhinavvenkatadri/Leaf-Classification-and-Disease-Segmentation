# Image Processing based ML Framework for Leaf Classification and Disease Detection


Abstract:
Image processing techniques are employed in this
paper to supplement machine learning models for categorizing
leaf species and detecting unhealthy spots in them. Multiple public
datasets were mixed with a self-curated dataset of leaves from a
homemade garden for the same. A set of 17 distinct features are
extracted from background-subtracted leaf photos to capture
information about texture, colour, and shape for leaf
classification. These characteristics are used to train machine
learning models such as Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest
Neighbors, which do not require hardware intensive training.
These models are trained on several dataset combinations,
including the merged one, and then compared using precision,
recall, and F1-score measures.
